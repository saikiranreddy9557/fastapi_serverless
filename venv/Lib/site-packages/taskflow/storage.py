            serialize (typically using ``json``) all
            atom :py:meth:`~taskflow.atom.Atom.execute` and
            :py:meth:`~taskflow.atom.Atom.revert` arguments to
            be able to transmit those arguments to the target worker(s). If
            the use-case being applied/desired is to later use the worker
            based engine then it is highly recommended to ensure all injected
            atoms (even transient ones) are serializable to avoid issues
            that *may* appear later (when a object turned out to not actually
