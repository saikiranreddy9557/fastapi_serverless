    """Listener that interacts [engine, job, jobboard]; ensures claim is valid.

    This listener (or a derivative) can be associated with an engines
    notification system after the job has been claimed (so that the jobs work
    can be worked on by that engine). This listener (after associated) will
    check that the job is still claimed *whenever* the engine notifies of a
    task or flow state change. If the job is not claimed when a state change
    occurs, a associated handler (or the default) will be activated to
    determine how to react to this *hopefully* exceptional case.

    NOTE(harlowja): this may create more traffic than desired to the
    jobboard backend (zookeeper or other), since the amount of state change
    per task and flow is non-zero (and checking during each state change will
    result in quite a few calls to that management system to check the jobs
    claim status); this could be later optimized to check less (or only check
    on a smaller set of states)

    NOTE(harlowja): if a custom ``on_job_loss`` callback is provided it must
    accept three positional arguments, the first being the current engine being
    ran, the second being the 'task/flow' state and the third being the details
    that were sent from the engine to listeners for inspection.
