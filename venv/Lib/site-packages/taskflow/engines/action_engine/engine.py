    This engine compiles the flow (and any subflows) into a compilation unit
    which contains the full runtime definition to be executed and then uses
    this compilation unit in combination with the executor, runtime, machine
    builder and storage classes to attempt to run your flow (and any
    subflows & contained atoms) to completion.

    NOTE(harlowja): during this process it is permissible and valid to have a
    task or multiple tasks in the execution graph fail (at the same time even),
    which will cause the process of reversion or retrying to commence. See the
    valid states in the states module to learn more about what other states
    the tasks and flow being ran can go through.

    * ``max_workers``: a integer that will affect the number of parallel
      workers that are used to dispatch tasks into (this number is bounded
      by the maximum parallelization your workflow can support).

    * ``wait_timeout``: a float (in seconds) that will affect the
      parallel process task executor (and therefore is **only** applicable when
      the executor provided above is of the process variant). This number
      affects how much time the process task executor waits for messages from
      child processes (typically indicating they have finished or failed). A
      lower number will have high granularity but *currently* involves more
      polling while a higher number will involve less polling but a slower time
      for an engine to notice a task has completed.
