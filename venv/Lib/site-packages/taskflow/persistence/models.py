        the incoming objects ``results`` attribute list is **always** iterated
        over and a new list is constructed with
        each ``(data, failures)`` element in that list having

        this is done that new list becomes (via assignment) this
        objects ``results`` attribute. Also note that if the provided object
        is this object itself then **no** merging is done.
