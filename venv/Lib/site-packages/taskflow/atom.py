    An atom is a named object that operates with input data to perform
    some action that furthers the overall flows progress. It usually also
    produces some of its own named output as a result of this process.

    :param name: Meaningful name for this atom, should be something that is
                 distinguishable and understandable for notification,
                 debugging, storing and any other similar purposes.
    :param provides: A set, string or list of items that
                     this will be providing (or could provide) to others, used
                     to correlate and associate the thing/s this atom
                     produces, if it produces anything at all.
    :param inject: An *immutable* input_name => value dictionary which
                   specifies  any initial inputs that should be automatically
                   injected into the atoms scope before the atom execution
                   commences (this allows for providing atom *local* values
                   that do not need to be provided by other atoms/dependents).
    :param rebind: A dict of key/value pairs used to define argument
                   name conversions for inputs to this atom's ``execute``
                   method.
    :param revert_rebind: The same as ``rebind`` but for the ``revert``
                          method. If unpassed, ``rebind`` will be used
                          instead.
    :param requires: A set or list of required inputs for this atom's
                     ``execute`` method.
    :param revert_requires: A set or list of required inputs for this atom's
                            ``revert`` method. If unpassed, ``requires`` will
                            be used.
    :ivar version: An *immutable* version that associates version information
                   with this atom. It can be useful in resuming older versions
                   of atoms. Standard major, minor versioning concepts
                   should apply.
    :ivar save_as: An *immutable* output ``resource`` name
                   :py:class:`.OrderedDict` this atom produces that other
                   atoms may depend on this atom providing. The format is
                   output index (or key when a dictionary is returned from
                   the execute method) to stored argument name.
    :ivar rebind: An *immutable* input ``resource`` :py:class:`.OrderedDict`
                  that can be used to alter the inputs given to this atom. It
                  is typically used for mapping a prior atoms output into
                  the names that this atom expects (in a way this is like
                  remapping a namespace of another atom into the namespace
                  of this atom).
    :ivar revert_rebind: The same as ``rebind`` but for the revert method. This
                         should only differ from ``rebind`` if the ``revert``
                         method has a different signature from ``execute`` or
                         a different ``revert_rebind`` value was received.
    :ivar inject: See parameter ``inject``.
    :ivar Atom.name: See parameter ``name``.
    :ivar optional: A :py:class:`~taskflow.types.sets.OrderedSet` of inputs
                    that are optional for this atom to ``execute``.
    :ivar revert_optional: The ``revert`` version of ``optional``.

    priorities executing (or reverting) before atoms with lower
    priorities (higher being defined as a number bigger, or greater tha
    an atom with a lower priority number). By default all atoms have the same
    priority (zero).

    sort those three by their priority before submitting them to be
    worked on (so that instead of say a random run order they will now be
    ran by there sorted order). This is also true when reverting (in that the
    sort order of the potential nodes will be used to determine the
